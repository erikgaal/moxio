General instructions:
- Use modern PHP 8.4 features
- Use strict type declarations
- Use type hints
- Only write docblocks if they add information not already in the code
- Use readonly classes by default, unless mutable state is required

Generate PHP classes for the OTL API objects and requests with the attached OpenAPI schema.
I'm only going to use the `vigerende-versie/concepten` and `vigerende-versie/concepten/{iri}` endpoints.
Generate Saloon requests and response objects and generate data classes for the API objects in those responses.
